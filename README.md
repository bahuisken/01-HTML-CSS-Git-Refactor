# Week 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## My Task

For this homework assignment, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. Meaning, the website should be functional and consumable by all different types of users. In addition, the codebase should be structured in a way that any developer can jump into the code and easily navigate to update and maintain. A benefit to this refactoring is not only is it accessible to all users, it is also optimized for search engines.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Refactors Performed 

```
* Changed HTML structure to utilize semantic HTML elements
    * Header, Nav, Section, Article, Aside, Footer
* Cleaned up HTML code errors
* Commented HTML file to ensure elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Added a concise, descriptive title
* Added alt text to all images
    * Removed emoji in footer and replaced with image that has alt text applied
* Fixed and tested all links to assure all function correctly
* Refactored CSS so that selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure
* Properly commented CSS File
* Enhanced Company name Text in Header to give more contrast between "seo" and other letters, Colorblind users should now see contrast
* Enhanced navigation to have hover property so that visually you can tell they are hyperlinks
```
